# CDS-miner

CDS-miner aligns a list of query CDS to a genome assembly to retreive similar CDS above a specific threshold. It works for eukaryote genomes with intron-exon structure.

## Dependencies



## Usage

Name query file 'query.fa' and change the extension of the assemblies into '.fasta' and put all files in the same directory as the source code.

run
```
bash CDS-miner.sh
```
